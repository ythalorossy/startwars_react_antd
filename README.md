# Star Wars API, React and Antd

The idea of this porject was refresh the React concepts and deep inside React Hooks.
I used the [Start Wars API](https://swapi.dev/api) to externalize the data, and [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) to customize the style of the components.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
